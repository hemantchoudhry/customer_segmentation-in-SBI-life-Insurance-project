## Market Segmentation in SBI Insurance
Welcome to the Market Segmentation in SBI Insurance project! This project focuses on segmenting SBI Insurance customers using clustering models to provide personalized product and service recommendations. By leveraging clustering techniques, we aim to identify distinct customer segments based on their characteristics and behaviors, enabling targeted marketing strategies and tailored offerings.


# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze SBI Insurance customer data and group customers into segments based on similarities in their demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences. By identifying distinct segments, we can better understand the diverse needs of customers and develop customized recommendations for insurance products and services.

# Features
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering algorithms to group customers into segments based on various features such as age, income, policy type, and claim history.
Personalized Recommendations: Provide personalized recommendations for insurance products and services tailored to each customer segment's preferences and requirements.
Scalable Solution: Develop a scalable solution capable of handling large volumes of customer data for real-time segmentation and recommendation generation.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of clustering models using metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and within-cluster sum of squares.
Integration: Integrate the segmentation and recommendation system with SBI Insurance's existing customer management platform for seamless deployment and utilization.

# Components
1. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess SBI Insurance customer data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as required for clustering algorithms.

2. Clustering Models
Implement clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics.

3. Recommendation Engine
Develop a recommendation engine to suggest insurance products and services tailored to each customer segment's preferences and needs.
